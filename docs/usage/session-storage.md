# Implementing session storage

As of v6 of the library, there is no `SessionStorage` implementations included and the responsibility for implementing session storage is now delegated to the application.

TODO

- provide an example of implementing session storage, clearly demonstrating how to store and retrieve/return `Session` objects.
